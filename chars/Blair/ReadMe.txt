----------------<Move Details>-------------------

 - Flying Neck Drop can catch foes in their hit states and isn't affected by the juggle system
 - Trick Kick hits low
 - Mashing buttons during Tsukami Hiza Kick increases hits, your opponent can mash to decrease hits
 - (EX)Sliding Arrow hits low and Blair will perform a leg takedown if p2 is standing(stand-type)
 - (EX)Shoot Kick has 4 possible change ups respectively:
  * Axe Kick is an overhead attack, while only the EX version will combo, it also causes the most damage
  * Straight Kick is the standard finish and is the second strongest finisher
  * High Kick is the weakest finisher, but launches p2 in the air, allowing for great juggle combos
  * Illusion Step isn't a attack at all, though rather Blair spins to get behind her foe.
    This tech is vulnerable to throws
 - EX Shoot Kick, along with all it's variants, can resist normal/special projectiles
 - (EX)Lightning Knee has invulnerability on start up
 - Shoot Upper is pretty slow on start up, but is unblockable for airbourne foes, and is best used for juggles
 - EX Shoot Upper comes out faster and Blair delivers 3 uppercuts
 - EX Crescent Wrench Kick hits 3 times and is best used for juggles
 - The initial flip kick portion of (MAX)Spin Side Shoot is an overhead
 - The final axe kick portion of (MAX)Dame Special is an overhead
 - Fairy Gift flipping portion is an overhead
 - Mash buttons during Fairy Gift to maximize damage 
 - All ground based hits for Shuttle Combination can not be blocked in the air
   
---------------<Gameplay Notes>------------------

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Most Normal standing/crouching attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Performing a Super/MAX Cancel resets the juggle points but also reduces damage dealt
   
MAX MODE:
 - Your attack and defense is increased while in MAX Mode
 - EX moves can be performed at no power cost, though take away from time sustained in MAX mode
 - All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode
 - All Lv2 and higher supers will cost 1 power bar, along with using up all time in MAX mode
 - Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
 - You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
 - You can not perform a Alpha Counter/Counter Movement while in MAX Mode
