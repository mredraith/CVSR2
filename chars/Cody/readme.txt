============Credits(in no particular order)===================
-JNP/Kong: sprites
-P.O.T.S: ex flash, various codes, some sounds, his sparks, I used his coding for a reference with the helpers. I directly took his spark coding.
-Jmorphman. He helped me out a couple times.
-Jesuszilla: Help on finding vels, timings, clsn stuff, cornerpush, general help on like... everything! If it wasnt for Jz, this character would be complete garbage! I cant thank him enough. Also, the small portrait was made by him.
-Zone and Layer: SF4 voice for Ken, Guile, Sagat, and Cammy
-Seph: palettes, bug testing/fixes, etc
-Reza: sounds/voices in some of my characters
-Sal-Azul: testing on my various creations
-Koopakoot: testing, coding tips and advice, being a nice guy, putting up with me being annoying lol
-LaQuak: a ton of advice, testing, help in general, shoryuken base. He also helped get me started in mugen.
-Cyanide: narutorials, coding help, he pretty much got me started in mugen.
-anjel: parry spark, dust effects

-warusaki3: I stole his shinryuken coding. I also used a couple of his vels. I also took his afterimages. Some sprites.
-H"-I stole his wall slam spark since I didnt feel like aligning mine.
-Capcom for not putting Karin and Alex in the same game which more or less led to me wanting to code in the first place.
-Rednavi: stun system triggering, coding advice at times.
-Swipergod: testing, coding tips/advice, he helped a lot in getting my coding better. Through Kofe, I improved quite a bit. The experience helped dramatically.
-Rajaaboy: I took his hitsounds from his RajaaRoa. Credit also to whoever originally ripped the sounds if it wasnt him. Either way, he still organized them for me more or less :)

-Whoever I got the dizzy sprites from. I dont remember who it was.

================[What's done?]=================
-all basics
-gethits
-specials
-ex specials
-2 throws
-3 supers
-system stuff
-cornerpush thanks to Jesuszilla
-defense scaling
-dampener of sorts, needs adjusting
-can tag with some characters. Works best with my Ken.
-reworked frame data to personal preference. Mostly cvs2 though.

What's left?:
-better dampener. It is too severe at times and too loose during others. I might just use SF4's
-minor tweaks on hitvels
-better AI 
-some system tweaks and changes. Better counter counter hit system. Better stun juggling.
-Adjust damages here and there.
-some tweaks overall here and there
-bug fixes
-adjusted tag coding
-Tag juggling issues and simul juggling issues.

=================[Legend]=========================================
x = Light Punch
y = Medium Punch
z = Heavy punch
a = light kick
b = medium kick
c = heavy kick
start = taunt

U = up
D = down
B = left/back
F = forward/toward/right

(A) = air only
(S) = special/super cancel(ground only)

System:
Parry: 
command = F(while standing or while in the air), D or F(while crouching). Must be done as your opponent is attacking you and requires decent timing.
-Allows the user to completely block an attack. If you time it wrong you might end up eatting an attack.

Safe fall:
command = D or X+y(as you are hitting the ground)
-lets you get up faster from landing by an opponents attack. It doesnt exactly make you 100% safer

EX moves: 
-Performed when you press an extra punch or kick when performing a special(if the move uses a punch command, then it is an extra punch, and if it is a kick command, then it is an extra kick in the command). EX moves have different vels and various other properties added. 

Tagging: (beta)
If you are in simul mode with my Ken (and possibly other characters) you can tag. Tagging is free as long as you dont use it while guarding(making a pseudo alpha/zero counter). Your partner isnt always invincible and the follow up move wont always hit. I didnt want a totally safe tagging method.
