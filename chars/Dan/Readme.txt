===============<Move Details>===============

- Kyuukyoku Tenchi Gadou Zuki is unblockable and can block one attack.

- You can perform free Lv3 Supers when in Mythical Taunt state, at free cost.
  (Connecting the Jun Koku Satsu / Otoko Michi, or performing the Hao Gadoken will end this state).

- Legendary Taunt can be cancelled (as long as he's not rolling) into any other Super
  (Lv1 for free, Lv2 cost 1 bar, and Lv3 cost three bars. Oyaji Blast & Lv3 Supers can be done even while rolling).

- The A.I. can randomly perform a stupidly powerful variation of the Kyuukoku Tenchi Gadou Zuki,
  not only unblockable, but invincible, and won't break Dan's hand.

- Oyaji Blast has invincibility to projectiles during its startup (when controlled by the A.I.).

- When Rolling Attack connects, Dan will bounce back if you hold that direction, and forward
  otherwise. You can also press Start to taunt afterwards.

- Rolling Taunt can be cancelled into Lv3 Supers / Oyaji Blast

- Crounching and Standing Taunts can be cancelled into Lv3 Supers

- Otoko Zuki can be connected into either Jun Koku Satsu or Otoko Michi.

- Premium Sign is an overhead, can't be blocked in mid-air, and nulifies projectiles on the startup.

- EX Uppercut is invincible at its start, so it works great as a "taunting counter"-

- Chouhatsu Densetsu completely fills Dan's powerbar if successful.

- Oyaji Blast's beam nulifies projectiles.

- Lv2 Shinkuu Gadou Ken resets juggle points if it hits.

- Jun Koku Satsu ignores projectiles.

- Otoko Michi is unblockable and invulnerable while he's dashing.

- After Otoko Michi you'll lose your whole life bar, but it won't kill you.

- You can't attack nor guard during Chouhatsu Shinwa, instead, every button makes Dan taunt.

- During Chouhatsu Shinwa you can perform a free Chouhatsu Densetsu, at any time.

- Shissou Buraiken has a much higher range than Hisshou Buraiken, can pass through projectiles, 
  and can easily damage airbone opponents. But does less damage, has a longer startup, 
  less invincibility time, and it's easier to punish.

- There's a secret that happens if you hold certain button as soon as you catch the opponnent
  with the Otoko Michi when (s)he can potentially be defeated by the move.
  See it for yourself ;)

	(CUSTOM-COMBO OPTIONS):
- Light (Air too) Dankuu Kyaku -> Medium Dankukyaku, Medium Dankuu Kyaku, (...).

(Speech translations by Kibagami)

LP -> Dan flexes his arm and says  "Yoshaa!" ("All right!"), or "Rakushou!" ("An easy win!")

me!), or "Kore ga Saikyou-Ryuu da!" ("This is the Saikyou style!")

LK -> Dan gives a thumbs up and says "Kimatta ze!" ("It's over!")

Win by Otoko Michi or Haoh Gadou Ken -> See for yourself! :D
Win by Jun Koku Satsu -> the kanji of "Father" is displayed on the background, resembling a Japanese painting, 
                         along with a little Shinto music. Dan does the HP Win Pose after Go dissappears.

<<<<<Extra lose poses>>>>>

Lose against my Morrigan (PotS), by letting her perform Eternal Slumber on Dan.
Lose against RajaaBoy's Len, by letting her perform MAX Transient Dream on Dan.

===============<Version History>===============

<18.11.2016>========================================<Mr.Ansatsuken's last edit>
- Added a HUGE color separation (thanks to Guileman! XD), 
  as well as an enormous amount of palettes (thanks to MFG! XD).
- Added Infinite's Palette-selector
- Changed the Shissou Buraiken's voice clips (half of them).
- Rolling Attack can go through Special projectiles
- Minor changes/bug fixes.
- Changed the Kyuukyoku Tenchi Gadou Zuki's charge-effect.
- Added a ton of Win Quotes.
- Minor changes/bug fixes.
- (To the Mugen 1.1 version): Added CAMERA-ZOOMS EVERYWHERE.
  Thanks to Beterhans for discovering this method.
  Before, it only had Zoom-compatible beams and projectiles.
  But now, the Super-pauses have zoom-in, the Otoko Michi, Shissou Buraiken,
  Jun Koku Satsu, and all throws TOO have Camera-Zoom.
  It's now a HUGE improvement from last version. It really feels like an actual fighting game.
  This is a major difference between the 1.1 and 1.0 versions.
  You can disable the Zoom in the CONFIG.TXT file.

<05.05.2016>
- The Shinkuu Gadouken can now be combo-ed into Oyaji Blast
- Rolling Taunt can now be cancelled into Lv3 Supers / Oyaji Blast
- Crounching and Standing Taunts can now be cancelled into Lv3 Supers
- You can now perform free Lv3 Supers when in Mythical Taunt state, at free cost
  (connecting the Jun Koku Satsu / Otoko Michi, or performing the Hao Gadoken will end this state)
- Legendary Taunt can be cancelled (as long as he's not rolling) into any other Super
  (Lv1 for free, Lv2 cost 1 bar, and Lv3 cost three bars. Oyaji Blast & Lv3 Supers can be done even while rolling)
- Shissou Buraiken can no longer be combo-ed from (MAX)/Shinkuu Gadouken.
  (Oh, well, it can, but only when the projectile can't deal any more hits/has started to vanish)
  (In other words, to combo a Shinkuu Gadouken into Shissou Buraiken, the Gadouken must have already dealt 5 hits)
- ALLAHU AKBAR!! Easter egg, lel
- Special lose poses added
- Mythical Taunt's voice clips will now sound correctly, heh
- Evil Dan (really basic stuff), Shakunetsu Gadouken, Danshura Senkuu and Metsu Gadouken have been coded.
  (Also, made the Danretsuken sprites already)
  (But that's it, it all is absolutely unfinished)
- New palettes
- Gou Hibiki's colors will also change depending on the palette, heh
- Minor changes/bug fixes
- T-that's it I guess. I wouldn't be surprised if I update the char again. I don't know myself anymore.

<28.01.2016>
- Jun Koku Satsu now ignores projectiles.
- Increased the Premium Sign's hitboxes.

- The Premium Sign has some kind of projectile-nulifying aura during its startup.
- Increased the Premium Sign's damage and cheap damage.
  (O-oh, yes you may think "sure you haven't made it OP, have you?"
  And no. You know, the Premium Sign is a "joke move", riiight?
  But c'mon, it was completely worthless. I merely made it less useless).
- Minor changes
- Added a special intro vs Jmorphman / Warusaki3's Joe Higashi 
  (Don't thank me. It was thanks to Knuckles8864! He made the whole intro).
- Improved A.I.
  (He will now use the Premium Sign. He wasn't gonna use it at all when controled bu the A.I.
  Also, he'll use the Jun Koku Satsu less frequently.
  And the Haoh Gadouken, instead, will be more usual).
- Minor changes/bug fixes.

<26.01.2016>
- Added the Jun Koku Satsu and Oyaji Blast Super moves!
- Fixed the bug that made dust appear in mid-air while using the aerial Saikyo-Bougyou (sometimes)

- Modified the target-animation of some moves.
- Improved Special effects again, of course.
- Improved A.I.

<24.01.2016>
- Fixed a HUGE bug with the "UNO TAG" system.
  (Why did it happen? I  tested it a shitload of times before uploading it...
   yet, the "Tag System (Custom).st" file just disappeared from the .DEF (so it didn't work at all)
    I don't EVER modify the .Def files, and I'm always using the "Uno Tag" system
     when I play Mugen... so whatever. No idea how it happened... but who cares anyway).
- Added countless Chouhatsu Shinwa Taunts ("Mythical Taunts").
- The Gadou Shoukouken and EX Special moves can no longer be blocked in mid-air.
- Aerial and Crouching Taunts deal a lil' bit more damage.
- Stuff I've forgoten / not worth mentioning.

<20.01.2016>
- Changed the Lv3 Super portrait.
- Koryuu Rekka can now be cancelled into Shissou Buraiken.
- Minor changes in taunts, special effects and stuff.

<14.01.2016>
- Converted to the "new" PotS CvS3 system.
  (Honestly though, I started editing this char long, long time ago... but I gave up.
  Just as (probably) many did, too. The amount of bugs that appeared as soon as I "patched" it
  was simply insane. I forgot 'bout this char until I realised how to fix it up.
  I-it wasn't an easy task, though... heheh...)
- Added the Haoh Gadouken, Shissou Buraiken, and MAX Hisshou Buraiken Super moves.
- Hisshou Buraiken is now a Lv1 Super move.
- EX Saikyou-Ryuu Bougyo can now be performed by pressing LP and HP.
- Improved the A.I. Like, a lot. He can even beat some bosses if lucky enough.
  (Don't you worry, he'll still taunt every 3 seconds, heh...)
- Improved all special effects.
- Can epicly interrupt my Akuma/Oni's Shun Goku Satsu with a Saikyo-Koryuuken.
- Added tons of RGB sprites to the 1.1 verison. Most system FX are RGB.
- Added compatibility with the "UNO TAG" system.
- Now compatible with Mugen 1.1's "Camera Zoom" system (only the Mugen 1.1 version, obiously).
- Added SFIV voice samples.
- Rolling taunts have now different types of invincibility.
- Changed the Gadouken's speed.
- Slightly Increased the speed of the Otoko Michi, and it's invincible again (while dashing).
  (So now it's less useless I guess, heheh)
- Fixed A LOT of bugs.
  (I'm surprised a PotS char had that many, actually).
- Zero Counter costs 750 power and it's performed by its regular command.
- Minor additions/changes/bug fixes (along with stuff I've forgot to mention).
- Holy shit, wait just there, it's been EXACTLY 6 years since he last updated the char...
