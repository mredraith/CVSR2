;====================<"UNO TAG" FILES>====================


Oh, hey, if you're reading this, I'd assume you know what the "UNO TAG" system is, don't you?
If you don't, go download it as soon as you can...
It is a program made by UnoShe that allows you to patch any character to be played like a Tekken / MvC game
while on "simul" mode. Hype as heck, isn't it?

Well, if you already knew that...

The "Command (Custom).cmd" will always perform the Shissou Buraiken while using the Team Hyper Combo.
(You gotta use the "Tag System (Custom).cns" too, in order to work)


The "Command.cmd" file will, instead, perform a regular Koryuu Rekka as a Lv1 Team Hyper,
and the Haoh Gadouken as a Lv3 Team Hyper Combo. But both of those have truly shity range...
(You gotta use the "Tag System.cns" file too, or it won't work)

So, if you're using the "Command.cmd" file, he'll still always perform the Shissou Buraiken
as his Team Hyper as long as you're playing with one of my chars as your teammate
(Akuma/Oni/Shin Akuma/Cyber Akuma/Shin Oni, Q, Ryu/Evil Ryu/Master Ryu, or Dudley).

So that while playing with (for example, Dudley), 
you'll see an epic combination of Shissou Buraiken and Rolling Thunder.
(Or Shissou Buraiken and MAX Critical Combo Attack, with Q)
(Or Shissou Buraiken and EX Messatsu Gou Hadou, with Akuma/transformed)
(OR... Shissou Buraiken and Metsu Hadouken, with Ryu/Evil/Master Ryu)


I modified all of these chars' A.I. so that they'll know WHEN to use the Team Hyper Combo, 
so that, when used by the A.I., it'll most likely always connect :D


Dan's partner assist move is the Dankuu Kyaku, but he might sometimes perform a Rolling Taunt instead.
And his anti-air assist move is the Koryuuken.
