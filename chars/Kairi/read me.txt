>Char tips:

- Like SFEX2 and 3, Kairi using your blue flammes in your hands have the ability to destroy some types of projectiles using his punch moves when the three power bars are full!
- The level 3 Hypermove Shouky Hatsudou is a good technique but be careful!!! After use it, kairi loses the ability of power charge, fall in the floor (maybe an expert player can hit you after it!), loses the ability to destroy fireballs with punchs, loses the blue flames,loses the hability to do the lv2 special move Maki Hatsudou and sacrifices 50% of his own life!!! "DO IT OR DIE"!!!
- Using the Ryujin Kyaku, you can jump over the enemy how many times you want if you hit the enemy (use it to run away of strong enemies)!
- Use the dodge atack to surprise your enemy!!!
- When Kairi use the blue flammes, normal moves like punches makes damage in the oponnent even during the block!
- After use Shouky Hatsudou, Kairi losts the Makuu Shihai ashura senku and use Maku Shihai teleport, like SFEX III!!!

>Personal info:

First name: Kairi 
Last name: ??? 
Blood type: ??? 
Eyes: Red 
Hair color: White 
Personal marks: Scar in his face 
Martial Art: The Animal Gods' techniques (Jackal, Dragon, Wolf) 
Clothes: Only use white pants 
Powers: Teleport, Blue Flames, Manifest the Animal God's powers 
Enemy: ALL, except Evil Hokuto 
Friend/Ally: Evil Hokuto Personality: quiet, misterious, and sometimes crazy (when he manifests the power of the Jackal God)

Known history: Kairi only symphatizes with Evil Hokuto, I don't know why (see in the move list a surprise relationed to her). His objective is to control the Animal God's Techs. 
In Street Fighter EX plus alpha, he hasn't manifested it yet. But in Street EX 2, he gaves some signals of his disarray. Now, in Street EX 3, he's almost totally crazy, he can only control himself after discharging almost all of his energy (the Shouki Hatsudou Meteo Combo).
