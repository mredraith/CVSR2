The co-protaginist of the Resident Evil series, the lovely Ms. Jill Valentine. Based off her MvC2/RE1 appearences,
this incarnation of Jill is before she became the battle hardened BSAA member we all know today.
As such, she was still in training during her S.T.A.R.S days. Her stamina/defense is lacking, along with her physical-
strength being a bit below average. While her speed/agility isn't as high as someone like Mai or Chun-Li,
it's still one of her advantage traits. Jill also has many firearms and a combat knife at her disposal.
The key to victory will be utilizing all her weapons and rushdowns to put pressure on your foes.

---------------<Gameplay Notes>------------------

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Most Normal standing/crouching attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - All Normal air attacks are Special and Super cancellable
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Performing a Super/MAX Cancel resets the juggle points but also reduces damage dealt
 - Ground normal chaining is possible. However, if you chain, you can NOT Special/Super cancel from normals.
   
MAX MODE:
 - Your attack and defense is increased while in MAX Mode
 - EX moves can be performed at no power cost, though take away from time sustained in MAX mode
 - All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode
 - All Lv2 and higher supers will cost 1 power bar, along with using up all time in MAX mode
 - Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
 - You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
 - You can not perform a Alpha Counter/Counter Movement while in MAX Mode
