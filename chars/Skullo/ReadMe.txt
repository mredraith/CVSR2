The charismatic super hero of the Street Fighter EX series, Skullomania! Full of surprises, Skullomania has a great-
variety of moves. Along with being a very well-balanced char stat-wise all around. Being the "wild card" he is, it's-
really up to you as a player what route you want to take with him when playing as him. One of my personal favorite-
fighting game chars of all time. Make full use of all of Skullo's attacks to confuse and overwhelm foes.

   it also has invulnerability during start up

--------------------<Q&A>------------------------

 Q: Why Skullomania?
 A: One of my all time favorite chars hands down.

 Q: Can I use something from this char?
 A: Yup, use w/e you need.

 Q: What can we expect from you next?
 A: One may never know...

 Q: What stage/music do you use for Skullomania? 
 A: His SFEX Plus Alpha(pirate game) stage made by Tamez. As for music, I'd suggest either his official theme from SFEX, 
    "Amusementive Crime". Or, WizzyWhipItWonderful's custom made track for Skullo. You can find Wizzy's custom track,
     on his YouTube channel.     

 Q: Can I make a patch/AI for Skullomania?
 A: Sure. 

 Q: Blah, blah, blah Ikemen/1.1?!
 A: I DO NOT make stuff for either one of those. 
    Do NOT tell me anything about them.
