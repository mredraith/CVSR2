The king of Muay Thai, Sagat. He's a powerhouse. With great skill and balance. Sagat punishes his,
foes with overwhelming projectile spamming and superb anti-air defense. His kicks and punches,
sting something fierce and have great reach. His stamina is also above the average male fighter. Able to,
take punishment and dish it out as well. Sagat's major drawback however, is his speed/agility...
He's slow as dirt lol. His combo-ability is also lacking because of this. It's best to keep things
short and sweet with him. Long extensive combos/juggles aren't Sagat's style/thing anyway. Make use of Sagat's,
projectiles while punishing foes who try to jump in over them with his great anti-air defense.

-----------------<Possible Extras/Things To Do>---------------------

 - Fix any issues based on feedback  
 
 
-----------------<Special Notes>---------------------

By default, (Ground)Tiger Bluff has been turned off. However, I like those abilities myself,
while I understand some may not. This is my way of compromising. If you would like for the Bluff-
techniques to be on, follow these simple steps...

1) Open DivineSagat.cmd with either Fighter Factory, or by right clicking on it, and then selecting "Edit".
2) Find their command triggers(not the commands for them themselves). They'll look like this:

;[State -1, Low Tiger Bluff]
;type = ChangeState
;value = 197
;triggerall = command = "Low Tiger Bluff"
;triggerall = RoundState = 2 && StateType != A
;trigger1 = ctrl || StateNo = 40 || StateNo = 52 || (StateNo = [100,101])
;trigger2 = var(5)

;[State -1, Tiger Bluff]
;type = ChangeState
;value = 196
;triggerall = command = "Tiger Bluff"
;triggerall = RoundState = 2 && StateType != A
;trigger1 = ctrl || StateNo = 40 || StateNo = 52 || (StateNo = [100,101])
;trigger2 = var(5)

3) Delete the semicolons(;) in front of each line of code.
4) Save it.

And that's it. By deleting the semicolons, it will enable the Bluffs to be active.

 
**There is a patch for H's Adon that makes him compatible with the special intro for Sagat. 
  Just apply accordingly by replacing his default files with the included patch.
