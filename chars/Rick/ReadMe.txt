=====<Gameplay Notes>=====
- Blazing moonburst fever is a counter
- Light version of divine blast is a fake
- step hook dodges high hits and counters, can still be hit with low hits
- crouching HP can be used as anti air

COMBO SYSTEM:
- he has a couple different combos, with his normals, i figured hes a boxer so he needs to throw punches in bunches!
- he can chain all normals into specials and supers
- cannot chain into step hook because it is used as a counter but the ex version can chain into oher specials
sort of like in the original.

COMBOS:
-LP, LK, HP, Shooting Star, Any Super
-LP, FWD+HP, HK
-MP, FWD+HP, HP, Shooting Star or Hellion, any super
-Crouch LP, LP, FWD+HP, HP, Shooting Star, Any Super
-Crouch LK, MK, FWD+LP, HK, RSD, Any Super
-(Corner) Jump HK, Crouch LK, MK, FWD+HP, HP, Shooting Star, Any Super

Of course you can mix and match these to your likings and probably find more!

MAX MODE:
 - Your attack and defense is increased while in MAX Mode
 - EX moves can be performed at no power cost, though take away from time sustained in MAX mode
 - All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode
 - All Lv2 and higher supers will cost 1 power bar, along with using up all time in MAX mode
 - Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
 - You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
 - You can not perform a Zero Counter while in MAX Mode

Extra Notes:
Rick Strowd has to be one of my favorite characters in gaming he has just this coolness about him
plus i love boxers and punching lol, He has been altered quite a bit but i managed to 
incorporate all of his moves pretty smoothly at first i didnt think i could but i did it.
he can combo pretty good not as much as heavy d! which is why he has a little bit more power.
enjoy guys and again let me know if u find any bugs!
