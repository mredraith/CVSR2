Nakoruru by PotS updated by HyperClawManiac/SirHyperClaw.

Changes:

- Modern PotS Hit/Super Sparks added.
- LVL3 Portrait added.
- Custom Combo changed to match Modern PotS standards.
- Super Afterimages no longer change when cancelled from another Super.
- Apefuchi Kamui Rimse changed to act like in SS2, added MAX version that behaves like the original.

To Do:

- Update Super Finish Text.
- Update Combo System so you can't do LVL1 Supers from LVL2 Supers.
- Add MAX versions of the rest of the LVL1 Supers.
- Maybe give Elerush Kamui Rimse a LVL1 Version.
