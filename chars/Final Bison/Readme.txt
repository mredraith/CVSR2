=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
