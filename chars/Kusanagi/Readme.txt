=====<Move Details>=====

 - Geshiki: Goufu You and Honofuri are overheads (except when canceled into); 127 Shiki: Yanosabi and EX R.E.D. Kick are also overheads.
 - Geshiki: Naraku Otoshi knocks down opponents in the air.
 - 114 Shiki: Aragami, 115 Shiki: Dokugami, 100 Shiki: Oniyaki, normal Kyo's EX 212 Shiki: Kototsuki Yo, and 1999 Shiki: Kiri Homura
   have autoguard.
 - Migiri Ugachi and Geshiki: Migiri Ugachi must be blocked low.
 - Kusanagi's EX 212 Shiki: Kototsuki Yo is an unblockable throw.
 - If the second hit of 75 Shiki: Kai hits an opponent, it can juggled afterwards with any attack; however, this can only be done
   once per combo. This also applies only the medium, heavy, and EX variants.
 - EX Aoki can be juggled afterwards with any attack; however, this can only be done once per combo.
 - Ura 108 Shiki: Orochinagi can avoid either high or low attacks while the move is being delayed, depending on which button is used
   to activate it. Using either light or medium punch will avoid low attacks, while using heavy punch will avoid high attacks.
 - The fire aura surrounding Kyo when he performs MAX Ura 108 Shiki: Orochinagi can hit opponents up to three times, and can destroy
   projectiles.
 - The pillar of fire that appears during Saishu Kessen Ougi "Mu-shiki" and Saishu Kessen Ougi "Zero Shiki" can destroy projectiles.
 - 182 Shiki, when fully charged, is unblockable.
 - 524 Shiki: Kamukura is an unblockable throw.



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Version History>=====

<12/09/18>
 - Fixed bug that made Aoki impossible to super cancel out of
 - Removed error that prevented MAX 182 Shiki from being charged up if activated by LP and HP
 - Slightly extended the opponent's lie down time during Issetsu Seoi Nage
 - minor fixes to the EXPLODsive Buffering system

<11/30/18>
 - Total revamp/recode. Added a more extensive color separation. Overhauled sprites, damage levels, animations, hitboxes, and coding.
   Now (mostly) uses frame data/velocities/timings from CvS2.
 - Hit sparks reduced 65% in size
 - Added EXPLODsive Buffering system, projectile reflection, and compatibility with the Reigi no Ishizue super from Vans's Chizuru.
 - Many, many moves are now based directly on KOF, using slightly modified animation timing/velocities from those games.
 - Changed normal mode's default pallete to use CvS2 colors.
 - EX Kyo mode added.
 - XIII taunt added for normal and EX modes.
 - Added the KOF98 intro vs. Benimaru to normal and EX modes.
 - Added a winpose vs. Iori.
 - Forward/backward roll made more accurate to CvS2
 - Kusanagi mode can no longer perform Hourin; Honofuri is now performed with heavy punch, Kurogami with medium punch. Crouching heavy
   kick is now a sweep variant of 88 Shiki, ala KOF94 Kyo.
 - If command canceled into, Geshiki: Goufu You will only combo after heavy attacks
 - Can no longer juggle off of Hourin.
 - Pushback on Geshiki: Naraku Otoshi increased.
 - The 114 Shiki: Aragami and 115 Shiki: Dokugami rekka chains can now juggle off themselves.
 - 115 Shiki: Dokugami now has autoguard; 115 Shiki: Dokugami Kai now has a greatly extended autoguard period.
 - The total damage of the entire 115 Shiki: Dokugami Kai chain has been decreased.
 - EX 100 Shiki: Oniyaki modified to resemble KOFXIII more, though with many less hits.
 - 212 Shiki: Kototsuki Yo can now be canceled out of during Custom Combo.
 - EX 212 Shiki: Kototsuki Yo is based on the EX version of KOFXIII EX Kyo (a blockable, short-range attack with autoguard). Kusanagi's
   EX variant is a command throw, like the EX version of KOFXIII normal Kyo.
 - EX Aoki can now be juggled from.
 - The HitPauseTime on the last hit of the first portion MAX Mu-shiki was decreased.
 - Max 182 Shiki now has Kyo set himself on fire, ala Mu-Shiki, MAX Orochinagi, et. al.
 - HitPauseTime for the final attack in Zero Shiki was increased.
 - Flames that appear on opponent when they are hit now disappear after a firm, set amount of time, exactly matching the PalFX applied
   to them. (They used to disappear if opponent regained control, or hit the floor if they were knocked down). This helps with stuff
   like 114 Shiki: Aragami -> 125 Shiki: Nanase, where a oppponent is hit by a fire-based attack, and then a physical attack, so that
   the fire will eventually disappear instead of remaining on the opponent until they hit the floor, as previous versions behaved.)

<09/05/11>
 - Fixed Yami Barai fire trail not pausing during superpause
 - EX Kototsuki You no longer gives back power
 - Throw damage changed
 - Changed around some canceling rules
 - HP Oniyaki now does all 2 hits when the opponent is in the air
 
<08/26/11>
 - Increased hittimes for first hit of Aoki and third hit of Kiri Homura
 - Opponents hit by Hourin in the air can no longer recover
 - Minor Mu-shiki position bug fixed
 - Removed glitch that gave Zero Shiki full invicibility throughout the entire move
 - Added 182 Shiki

<01/16/11>
 - Damage output adjusted
 - Bug where Custom Combo damage wasn't dampened fixed
 - Increased hitvels in canceled Hourin, removing some overpowered combos
 - Increased hittime of Naraku Otoshi
 - New small portraits by Jesuszilla
 - Only the final hit of Issetsu Seoi Nage and Kamukura will kill an opponent
 - Dokugami Kai hittime increased
 - Fixed bug where the landing sound in far standing heavy kick cut off the hitsound
 - Fixed error that prevented Yami Barai from being supercanceled out of
 - Made canceling out of Aoki more lenient

<v.01/05/11>
 - AI fixes
 - Some sounds redone
 - Fixed a Kamukura bug
 - Made level 1 Kiri Homura canceling more strict
 - LP and MP Oniyaki damage values fixed
 - Kototsuki You damage was reduced

<v.01/02/11>
