----------------<Move Details>-------------------
 
 - Kouryuu Koukyaku Geri is an overhead when performed raw
 - Nidan Sokutou Geri hits low
 - EX Ryuugeki Ken hits twice and knocks foes down
 - (EX)Ryuuga initial hit, (EX)Gen'ei Kyaku, (MAX)Haoh Shokoken, and (MAX)Ryuko Ranbu can not be air guarded
 - EX Ryuuga has invulnerabilty up to the apex of his jump along with more juggle potential
 - (EX)Kyokugen Renbu Kyaku is unguardable
 - EX Kyokugen Renbu Kyaku resets the juggle points, allowing you to follow up with any attack
 - EX Hien Senpuu Kyaku resists normal/special projectiles, along with the final kick knocks foes down
 - Hoah Shokoken's speed changes depending on the button strength used to perform it
 - Ryuko Ranbu's distance changes depending on the button strength used to perform it
 - Zetsu Ryuko Ranbu is unguardable and Robert is invulnerable throughout the startup/initial dashing- 
   attack portion of the move. However, it has slow startup and leaves him wide open if dodged.
   It's a high risk, high reward technique.
   
---------------<Gameplay Notes>------------------

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Most Normal standing/crouching attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Normal attacks can be command canceled into Kouryuu Koukyaku Geri/Ryuu Hanshuu/Nidan Sokutou Geri
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Performing a Super/MAX Cancel resets the juggle points but also reduces damage dealt

 - All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode

 - Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
 - You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
 - You can not perform a Alpha Counter/Counter Movement while in MAX Mode
