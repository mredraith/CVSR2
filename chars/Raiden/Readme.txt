=====<Move Details>=====

 - During Bear Hug, you and your opponent can mash buttons to respectively increase or
   decrease the number of hits.
 - The start of Giant Bomb makes Raiden invincible.
 - You may cancel Giant Bomb by pressing x+a when Raiden is fully crouched to the
   ground. You cannot feint EX Giant Bomb.
 - The more time you charge two kicks, the more powerful Super Dropkick will be.
 - Jumping Lariat Drop is an unblockable move, however you cannot combo into it, or you'll be open.
 - Front Suplex cannot be comboed into if your opponent has blocked Combination Bodyblow.
 - EX Combination Bodyblow is a three part move. It goes from EX Combination Bodyblow,
   Headbutt, and finally Front Suplex.
 - Thunder Crush Bomb is shorter the stronger the button pressed (except EX Thunder Crush Bomb,
   however, that might be changed.)
 - The startup for Raiden Bomber to the punch, like Giant Bomb, makes Raiden invincible until the punch is out.


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
