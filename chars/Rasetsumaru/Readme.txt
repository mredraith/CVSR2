=====<Move Details>=====

 - After Hitotsu Nage and Hien Kiri the opponent cannot Fall Recovery.
 - Fake Senpuu Retsu Zan is an feint move, has less recovery so use it to fill the Power Bar.
 - EX Ougi: Kogetsu Zan has autoguard.
 - Ougi: Resshin Zan is an overhead.
 - EX Ougi: Resshin Zan can OTG.
 - Sake Kogeki can destroy projectiles.
 - Nagi Yaiba can counter physical attacks, and it's also a grab.
 - Shitatari hurts yourself, but can't kill you. After the damage, you'll receive an damage boost for the next 8 seconds.
 - Zoubu Eguri can only be performed during round 2/3 if oponent's life is relatively low.

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
