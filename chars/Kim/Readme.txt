=====<Move Details>=====

 - During Haishuukyaku you can hold either forward or backward to move in that direction
 - Haitengedankyaku, Ingotokyaku, the first hit of Ryuseiraku, and Hakikyaku must be blocked low.
 - Nerichagi (except when canceled into), Reverse Nerichagi, and the second hit of EX Ryuseiraku are overheads.
 - Hakikyaku can destroy grounded projectiles.
 - Hououhitenkyaku resets the juggle points if it connects; however, it can only hit an opponent once per combo.
 - Zero Kyori Hououkyaku is an unblockable throw.


-Hououhitenkyaku pause time increased; no long plays hitsound incorrectly (if u hit with it then do it again the sound would play even though youre not hitting the opponent)


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
