=====<Move Details>=====

 - Canterbury Blue has autoguard properties and will block non-super attacks and projectiles. Eagle will block
   jumping/high-level, mid-level, or low moves, depending on what button is used to activate the move.
 - EX Oxford Red has upper body invincibility during the start of the move, when Eagle is dashing forward.
 - Liverpool White and London Silver are overheads.
 - St. Andrews Green reflects projectiles at an angle which is determined by the button pressed to use the move.
 - The distance covered by Liverpool White and London Silver is determined by which button is used to activate 
   it (or combination of buttons, in London Silver's case).


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Canceling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
