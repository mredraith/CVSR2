=====<Move Details>=====

 - Hiji Otoshi is an overhead move
 - Hayagake makes Maki run forward. Pressing a makes her stop. Pressing b makes her slide down, which can only be blocked
   on crouch which if hit, gets a grapple. Pressing c makes her jump into a kick, which is an overhead
 - Saka Hayagake makes Maki run backwards. Pressing a makes her stop. Pressing b makes her jump forward. Pressing c makes
   her jump backwards
 - Pressing D, DB, B, k while in Hayagake makes Maki go into Saka Hayagake, and vice versa.
 - You can only do Hassoukyaku only from the wall behind Maki, not in front of her. She also has two versions of EX. 
   One for punch, and one for kick
 - Reppukyaku makes her lose a bit of life
 - Tesshinhou acts like Hayagake. Press one of the kicks to activate it
 - Ajaratengu can be used in the air, or on the ground only after you land
 - The air version of Ajaratengu is a little stronger than that of the ground version
 - Super Reppykyaku makes her lose a bit of life


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start


=====<Things That May or May Not Be Added>=====
 - A better A.I.
 - Figure out how to Custom Combo from Slams of Kage Sukui and Kubikari
 - Maybe get the win walk from the Final Fight series vs Mad Gear Gang
