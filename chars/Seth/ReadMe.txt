---------------<Gameplay Notes>------------------

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Most Normal standing/crouching attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Performing a Super/MAX Cancel resets the juggle points but also reduces damage dealt
   
MAX MODE:
 - Your attack and defense is increased while in MAX Mode
 - EX moves can be performed at no power cost, though take away from time sustained in MAX mode
 - All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode
 - All Lv2 and higher supers will cost 1 power bar, along with using up all time in MAX mode
 - Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
 - You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
 - You can not perform a Zero Counter while in MAX Mode
