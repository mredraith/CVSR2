=====<Move Details>=====

 - This version of Geshiki: Goufu In "Shinigame" does 2 hits, but only the 2nd Hit is an overhead.
 - Tsumagushi and Shiki 311: Saku Tsumagushi are overhead moves. You may cancel Tsumagushi into Aoi Hana.
 - The second hit of EX Kototsuki In can pick up and damage opponents on the ground, however does the same damage as the Light Version.
 - EX Tsumagushi is invincible to projectiles, however can still be hit by regular attacks
 - You cannot grab an opponent that has been hit by Shiki 108: Ya Sakazuki.
 - Shiki 306: Saika can only be performed right after finishing Level 1 Shiki 1201: Ya Otome.
 - Ura 1029 Shiki: Homurabotogi is unblockable, but hits only when it lands, so it's fully vulnerable while is in air.
 - You can cancel Aoi Hana into Ura 1029 Shiki: Homurabotogi, however it requires good timing.
 - San Shingi No Ni is unblockable, however, you cannot combo into it.
 - *Chi No Bousou is a counter attack. You're inmune to all projectile attacks during most of the move, but totally vulnerable to grab 
   attacks. He can counter all other attacks, even super moves.
 - You can set Chi No Bousou by getting rid of all the ;'s inside the command line
 - You can also change EX 100 Shiki: Oniyaki to regular or KoF XIII by changing the line from 1140 to 1130

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
