=====<Move Details>=====

 - Jaguar Crunch and Jaguar Tooth are overheads.
 - Keep tapping punch buttons to extend Thosand Jaguars indefinitely.
 - Thousand Jaguar can also be performed by inputting "F, DF, D, DB, B, p"; much like the standard way of performing the move, it can      
   be extended by mashing one or more of the punch button(s).
 - EX Thousand Jaguar and J.V.A. Thousand Jaguar can be juggled afterwards.
 - Jaguar Revolvers can be regulated by strenght of button for short(LK, LK+MK)/normal(MK, LK+HK)/far(HK, MK+HK) leap.
 - To use J.V.A. Thousand Jaguar you must press the button after forth, but BEFORE fifth hit.
 - Unlike J.V.A. Thousand Jaguar, Jaguar Assassin can be executed right on fifth hit, but still not before forth hit.
 - Jaguar Avalanche will work in full force only if BOTH hits are connected.

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start

=====<Miscellaneous>=====

 - Adon got three sound packs.
    -If you want to hear his SFA3 voice, then use "SoundSFA.snd".
    -If you want to hear his English SSF4 voice, then use "SoundUSA.snd"
    -If you want to hear his Japanese SSF4 voice, then use "SoundJPN.snd"

=====<Special Thanks>=====
 - H"- well, in fact, for a lots of stuff. Coding, sprites, framerates and hitboxes from his Adon. You can literally call
 my Adon a P.o.T.S. styled recreation of his Adon.
 - Jmophhman- for making Joe Higashi I used as template back in days. Keep going, man, your stuff is great.
 - Varo_Hades- you can call him co-author of this Adon. He made color separation and created edit I used to continue.
 Unfortunately, after THIS update there will be not a thing he used to edit back then, but still.
 - Hades for the hyper portrait and finish fonts.
 - Zombiebrock and a lots of guys for palettes.
 - Capcom for making original character
 - To all people, who helped me with creating this char.
