Customized version of Capcom's Ingrid, for MUGEN 1.0.
Based primarily on her SFA3 appearance, although is basically the same as CFE.
Customizable options, including alternate hitsparks and choosing between Custom Combo or
MAX Mode. Open "custom.txt" for info.
17 Palettes
2 Big Portraits and 3 Hyper Portraits for you to choose.

COMMENTS:

Ingrid is one of my favorite characters, even though most people don't like or even hate her.
I love her design, the way she fights without even being in a real fighting stance, looks like
she is always toying with her opponents. I wish capcom would make Ingrid appear in more games,
give more clues about her history, etc. Ingrid needs more love!
This creation is opensource, you can take whatever you want from it, just give me credit
and give credit to people who I took resources from, see "SPECIAL THANKS" near the end of this
document to know more.

MOVE DETAILS:

Sunbright is an overhead
You can use Sunshot and EX Sunshot again as soon as the previous projectile start to disappear
EX Sunshot will follow the opponent for some time
EX Sun Arch have a short invulnerability window at the start
MAX Sunburst will 'explode' if the opponent jump over or crouch
Sun Delta is unblockable

COMBO SYSTEM:

Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:

Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
Juggle limite is lifted
You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start

MAX MODE:

Attack and Defense are increased while in MAX Mode
EX moves can be performed at no power cost, though take away from time sustained in MAX mode
All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode
All Lv2 and higher supers will cost 1 power bar, along with using up all time in MAX mode
Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
You can not perform a Zero Counter/Counter Movement while in MAX Mode
