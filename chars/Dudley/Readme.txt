=====<What's Missing>=====

=====<Version History>=====

<14.10.2016>
- Reduced all damage. He was kinda broken imo, since, it's just Dudley.
  He might be cool af, yeah, but he's not a boss char-
  (A high-tier one, indeed, but not a boss chararcter.)
- Improved the special effects of the MAX Rolling Thunder
- Fixed the one bug with the delayed hitspakrs.
- Made a shitload of minor changes/bug fixes
- Look the 13.07.2015 update up m8, I didn't get to post it back then.

<13.07.2015>
- The rose can now be hit by any projectile/attack.
- The Rolling Thunder will connect mor efficently.
- Fixed a bug that made the Corkscrew Cross get the opponent lay down ifninitely.
  (rarely happened, but still... )
- Added different types of invincibility in most of the moves.
  (Machine Gun Blow has invincibility to normal projectiles during the startup, etc)
- Changed the GuardFlag of most EX Specials.

<29.06.2015>
- Fixed the one bug with the "normal" .DEF files... heh <:D

<21.06.2015>
