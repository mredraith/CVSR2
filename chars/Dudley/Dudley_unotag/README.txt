;====================<"UNO TAG" FILES>====================


Oh, hey, if you're reading this, I'd assume you know what the "UNO TAG" system is, don't you?
If you don't, go download it as soon as you can...
It is a program made by UnoShe that allows you to patch any character to be played like a Tekken / MvC game
while on "simul" mode. Hype as heck, isn't it?

Well, if you already knew that...

The "CommandEasy (Custom).cmd"/"Command (Custom).cmd" will always perform the Rolling Thunder while using the Team Hyper Combo.
(You gotta use the "Tag System (Custom).cns" too, in order to work)


The "CommandEasy.cmd"/"Command.cmd" file will, instead, perform a Rocket Uppercut as a Lv1 Team Hyper,
and the MAX Rolling Thunder as a Lv3 Team Hyper Combo. But the first one has truly shity range...
(You gotta use the "Tag System.cns" file too, or it won't work)

So, if you're using the "CommandEasy.cmd"/"Command.cmd" file, he'll still always perform the Rolling Thunder
as his Team Hyper as long as you're playing with one of my chars as your teammate
(Akuma/Oni/Shin Akuma/Cyber Akuma/Shin Oni, Dan, Q, or Ryu/Evil Ryu/Master Ryu).

So that while playing with (for example, Dan), 
you'll see an epic combination of Rolling Thunder and Shissou Buraiken.
(Or Rolling Thunder and EX Messatsu Gou Hadou, with Akuma/Oni/Shin Akuma/Cyber Akuma/Shin Oni)
(Or MAX Rolling Thunder and EX Messatsu Gou Hadou, with Oni/Shin Akuma/Cyber Akuma/Shin Oni, if you've got 3 full power bars)
(Or Rolling Thunder and Metsu Hadouken, with Ryu/Evil/Master Ryu)
(OR... Rolling Thunder and MAX Critical Combo Attack, with Q)


I modified all of these chars' A.I. so that they'll know WHEN to use the Team Hyper Combo, 
so that, when used by the A.I., it'll most likely always connect :D


Dudley's partner assist move is the Machinegun Blow.
And his anti-air assist move is the Jet Upper.
