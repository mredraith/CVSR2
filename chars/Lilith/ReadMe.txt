---------------<Gameplay Notes>------------------

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Most Normal standing/crouching attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Most Air attacks can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Performing a Super/MAX Cancel resets the juggle points but also reduces damage dealt
 - Ground normal chaining is possible with Lilith. However, if you chain, you can NOT Special/Super-
   cancel from her normals.
   
MAX MODE:
 - Your attack and defense is increased while in MAX Mode
 - EX moves can be performed at no power cost, though take away from time sustained in MAX mode
 - All Lv1 supers can be performed at no power cost, though immediately uses up all time in MAX mode
 - All Lv2 and higher supers will cost 1 power bar, along with using up all time in MAX mode
 - Even without a power bar, as long as you have time left in MAX mode, you can perform Lv1 supers/EX moves
 - You can not Power Charge/gain power while in MAX mode
 - You can not perform a Alpha Counter/Counter Movement while in MAX Mode
 
--------------------<Q&A>------------------------

 Q: Why Lilith?
 A: For double my pleasure... Seriously though because I love Li Kun's work.
    Even if this set in itself is "unofficial" in a sense.

 Q: Can I use something from this char?
 A: Yup, use w/e you need.

 Q: What can we expect from you next?
 A: One may never know...

 Q: What stage/music do you use for Lilith? 
 A: Nothing!     

 Q: Can I make a patch/AI for Lilith?
 A: Sure. 

 Q: Will you add blood FX to Lilith?
 A: Nope.

 Q: Will you add her "Gloomy Puppet Show" super?
 A: Nope.

 Q: Will you make/include an alternate sound file using her DS voices?
 A: No. I also got rid of it. It needlessly increases the file size.
    I'm sure you're capable of making or finding an alt voice if you want.

 Q: Blah, blah, blah Ikemen/1.1?!
 A: I DO NOT make stuff for either one of those. 
    Do NOT tell me anything about them.
