=====<Move Details>=====

 - Geshiki: Goufu You and Ge Shiki: Zu Tsui are overheads (Goufu You isn't when canceled into).
 - 114 Shiki: Aragami and EX 100 Shiki: Oniyaki have autoguard
 - 720 Shiki: Homuragasane (But the MP version) can negate projectiles
 - Ura 108 Shiki: Orochinagi can avoid either low or high attacks while the move is being delayed,
   depending on which button is used to activate it. Using either light or medium punch will avoid
   low attacks, while using heavy punch will avoid high attacks.
 - The pillar of fire that appears during 1127 Shiki: Tsumugari (lvl1 only) can destroy projectiles.
 - In Chou Yami Barai Saisyu recovers before the move ends.


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
