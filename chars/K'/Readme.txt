=====<Move Details>=====

 - On counter hit One Inch Punch wall bounces P2, except when command canceled, along with reseting the juggle points.
 - Knee Assault is an overhead (except when canceled into).
 - EX Minutes Spike has autoguard.
 - Secondary Bites has Low hit detection.
 - EX Black Out is completely invincible.
 - Heat Drive and MAX Heat Drive are unguardables if they're fully charged.


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
