This is a patched/updated version of the Mugen game [Capcom vs SNK Evolution Rev 2](https://gamejolt.com/games/Capcom_vs_SNK/509026), due to its current release being very oddly balanced.

Some of the listed changes made are
* Normalizing life/power values across the entire cast (1000 health, 3000 power)
* Normalizing fastest attack speed at 3f startup
* Fixing bugs and glitches such as:
* * Fireballs disappearing right at the edge of the screen
* * Some stages crashing in arcade mode (got rid of all of them lol)
* * Half circle motions not being consistent
* Grappler 360s ate replaced with both-way half circles
* Throws now have proper okizeme, and all charactes get up faster (15f liedown time compared to 60f)
* Shin Akuma and God Rugal now have very funny divekicks that can combo into itself
* Some characters that didn't have hyper hops now have functioning hyper hops
* E. Honda and Chun Li can now QCF for mash attacks
